			<h3>My PRK Experience: Day Fourteen</h3>
			<h4><i>Thursday, April 24th 2015</h4></i>
			I was able to go back to work this past week but it was hard to see my computer screen so I had to wear my bootleg eyeglasses which everyone thought was hilarious (ha.ha.). The vision in my right eye has been fluctuating drastically throughout the day/week. When I first wake up, I feel like I can see crystal clear out of my right eye, but as soon as I get to work, everything is blurry again. I had another meeting with my doctor this past Thursday and he said my eye is healing very slowly and he wants to see me in a week to determine when I can get the other eye done/make sure it's healed a bit more. I have  feeling I'm going to be seeing him once a week for the next few weeks until my eye is healed before he decides that I can finally get my left eye done. Hopefully I'm wrong and he decides next week but we'll see. He also said that the fact that my eyes have been fluctuating so much means they're stil healing. I haven't been in any pain so that's been great. My eye has been very dry so I've been putting non-preservative lubricating drops in it very frequently. I'm going to start wearing a contact in my left eye because the eyeglasses with a patch is not a good look, hopefully I'm able to last throughout the day with my contact.

			<h3>My PRK Experience: Day Seven</h3>
			<h4><i>Friday, April 17th 2015</h4></i>
			I took off of work today as well and stayed in the dark for most of the day. My eye felt sore from being in so much pain the day before but it was getting better. The vision in my right eye is still pretty blurry, both near and far.

			<h3>My PRK Experience: Day Six</h3>
			<h4><i>Thursday, April 16th 2015</h4></i>
			I tried to go to work today and wore my glasses with the electrical tape and a baseball hat. I work in a financial firm so I stood out like a sore thumb. I probably looked like I was beat up or something. It was hard for me to look at hte screen without my eyes watering and the contact was scratching my eye worse than ever. I moved my appointment earlier and left work because I couldn't take it anymore. There was another doctor there who was subbing in for my doctor since he was at a conference. This new doctor had no clue what to do with me and couldn't understand why I was in pain. I eventually convinced him to take the contact bandage off (which is what he was supposed to do in the first place) and I felt a little relief. He gave me a spare contact bandage to take home just in case the pain got worse but it seemed to get better. I still can't see up close and it's now pretty blurry far away as well. Mreh.

			<h3>My PRK Experience: Day Five</h3>
			<h4><i>Wednesday, April 15th 2015</h4></i>
			My boyfriend made me call my doctor oday and my doctor told me to come in so he could check on me, but since I was in so much pain I didn't want to move, so he told me to try and change the contact with another one I have (even though it had a prescription, I wasn't sure how that was going to work). So I tried but couldn't get the contact out so I left it in and figured I'd wait until my appoinment the next day. I had to take off of work today too and my boyfriend even took off as well because I was so miserable. Worst pain of my life, and I have to go through this all over again with my left eye ....

			<h3>My PRK Experience: Day Four</h3>
			<h4><i>Tuesday, April 14th 2015</h4></i>
			Today was the worst day yet. I had an appointment with my doctor for him to check on my contact to see if I could get it removed. I was hoping he would since it's scratching my eye. He said my eye wasn't healed enough for it to get removed but that he would replace the contact since it sometimes gets build up from all of the drops. His assistant switched my contact bandage and it felt so much better afterwards! Then, a little while after getting home, my eye started throbbing with pain. I took Advil but it didn't work and my boyfriend was keeping track of how much I was taking and he wouldn't let me take more (bless his soul). I felt like there was a knife in my eye and I didn't know what to do, for over twelve hours this went on for. My boyfriend made me call my doctor the next day and my doctor told me to come in so he could check on me, but since I was in so much pain I didn't want to move, so he told me to try and change the contact with another one I have (even though it had a prescription, I wasn't sure how that was going to work). So I tried but couldn't get the

			<h3>My PRK Experience: Day Three</h3>
			<h4><i>Monday, April 13th 2015</h4></i>
			My right eye is starting to get irritated by the contact bandage. I'm not going to wear a contact in my left eye either because you have to wait two weeks after you stop wearing contacts to get eye surgery, so I'm going to try and beat the system. I put electrical tape over my right lens because when I try to look through it, I get really dizzy. I look absolutley rediculous but it seems to do the trick. I took today and tomorrow off from work so I've been in the dark all day. It's hard for me to see close up with my right eye, everything is so blurry. I used to always be able to see close up so now I'm fully relying on my left eye to looks at my phone/read. I hope that clears up soon because I stare at a computer for 10 hours a day for work.

			<h3>My PRK Experience: Day Two</h3>
			<h4><i>Sunday, April 12th 2015</h4></i>
			My eyes both feel a little tired today. Since I don't wear contacts for a long period of time anymore, my left eye felt really dry and irritated. My right eye felt a little sore but I could still see clearly out of if so that's great. I'm taking my drops and wearing my night guard still. No pain today either :]

			<h3>My PRK Experience: Day One</h3>
			<h4><i>Saturday, April 11th 2015</h4></i>
			My follow up was done by my doctor's assistant and it was short and sweet. He checked my eye to made sure the bandage was still on and that everything looked ok. I put a contact in my left eye and I could see clear as day with my right eye, it felt amazing! I went to Lenscrafter to get the prescription in my right lens removed because I want to wear my glasses until my right eye heals. I couldn't wear the glasses yet because I needed sunglasses on when I went outside so I put a contact in my left eye for the day. I felt so great that I was even able to travel out of town for the weekend. I was a little nervous that I would experience the pain from the day before so I brought extra Advil but the pain never came. I'm so happy!

			<h3>My PRK Experience: Surgery</h3>
			<h4><i>Friday, April 10th 2015</h4></i>
			So the surgery was pretty terrifying but all went well. I was so nervous (even though they gave me a pill to calm be down) and the fact that you're awake and can't close your eye made it a thousand times worse. I felt a lot of pressure from the doctor's tools and every time I saw the forceps, it made me queasy. They first put in numbing drops, then put in these drops that essentially ate away at my eye, then he started scraping all of the gunk off of my eye. Then they put a contact bandage over my pupil to help it heal. Thank goodness the surgery was only a few minutes, I think I would've thrown up if it was any longer. After the surgery, I just wanted to lay down. My eye felt exhausted and when I got home, I was in a lot of pain. My eye was throbbing and I wasn't given any pain medications or comfort drops so I took two Advils which seemed to do the trick. The pain went away within the hour and all was well. They taped a clear plastic guard over my eye which I took off later that night to make sure I could see. It was a little blurry but I could see so that was a relief! It was hard to open my eye and it was really sensitive so I covered it back up and went to sleep. The next day, I had to see the doctor bright and early for my follow up.

			<h3>My PRK Experience: Pre-Operation</h3>
			<h4><i>Thursday, April 9th 2015</h4></i>
			Tomorrow, I'm having my PRK surgery done on my right eye after work. I'm pretty nervous/excited/anxious/scared + a million other emotions all rolled into one. I hope there's no pain and that I heal quickly so I can get my left eye done asap. A few of my friends and co-workers were telling me about their experiences and they made it seem like a piece of cake, but they all had LASIK which is slightly different that PRK. My healing time is much slower since the entire flap has to grow back, unlike LASIK where they lift, operate, and put the flap back down. I started putting antibiotic drops in my eye yesterday as per the doctor, and tomorrow they'll recheck my eyes and give me a Xanax before the surgery. I hope there are no complications, wish me luck!
